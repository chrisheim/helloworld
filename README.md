Hello!

My name is Christopher Heim and I am a full time student at King's College located in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania. I am currently working on obtaining my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. This fall, due to a better program, I will be transfering to Bloomsburg University to continue working on my degree in Computer Science.
